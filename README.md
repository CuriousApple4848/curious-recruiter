# Hi, I'm Art — the Curious Recruiter ex-Amazon ex-Google ex-Facebook

I'm a talent advisor who partners with early-stage founders to help them build exceptional engineering teams. I made this repo because I'm endlessly curious about how engineers think, build, and grow.

## 🔍 What’s in this repo?

- `philosophy.md` — How I approach recruiting and why I work the way I do
- `outreach/` — Sample outreach messages (real ones I write)
- `notes/` — Technical topics I’m learning about (yes, really)
- `resources/` — Stuff I share with engineers about early-stage startups

This isn’t here to sell you anything — it’s here because I like thinking in public and learning out loud.
